  <Accordion title="Q: What's the difference between Unlimited Card and Credits" icon="money-bill-wave" iconType="regular">
    Unlimited Card and Credits are two types of account resources on this platform, corresponding to official monthly billing and API pay-as-you-go billing respectively. The mirror site is a 1:1 replica of the official website, including the official **monthly payment** Unlimited Card consumption

    The aggregation site essentially calls various model APIs for use on our frontend website, so it also adopts **pay-as-you-go** credit consumption

    However, users can rest assured that regardless of the billing method, both are much cheaper than official prices
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Q: Why do longer conversations consume more credits" icon="face-confused">
    AI has no memory, so the principle of multi-turn conversations with AI is essentially: <u>each conversation sends all previous conversation records to AI</u>. As the number of conversation turns increases, the request tokens sent to AI will naturally increase, so consumption will gradually increase

    However, users can control how many recent messages are sent in each conversation through **Number of Historical Messages** in the model selection dropdown menu to reasonably control model memory and consumption
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Q: Common Mirror Site Errors" icon="brake-warning">
    Users may often see **"you have sent too many message...."** or similar errors on Claude mirror sites. This is actually because official websites of any AI have **rate limits** due to the subscription system:

    That is, an account can only send a limited number of messages per unit of time. However, this platform supports **opening a new conversation** to switch to another available account, so if your current conversation is limited, opening a new conversation will solve the problem

    <Note>
      Please note! If you see prompts asking you to upgrade to Plus or Max subscriptions, please do not click, as that is reminding you that the account behind your current conversation is upgrading its subscription. Your only credential for using this platform is the Login Code, which has no connection to official website prompts

  <Accordion title="Q: Why can't the aggregation site upload files" icon="upload">
    Current AI models only have text and image processing capabilities, so uploading files is not a native model capability

    The website is responsible for uploading and parsing files, while the model essentially still processes text and images in the files

    You can integrate our API into third-party platforms that support file parsing (such as Chatbox) for use, or manually pass the content in files to AI, which will achieve exactly the same effect, because this is essentially how AI works

    <Tip>
      We will soon support file upload functionality, please follow our recent updates page～

  <Accordion title="Q: Why didn't I receive credits for inviting someone" icon="star-of-david">
    New users who **join us for the first time** through your **Referral Link** will establish a binding relationship with you

    You can check the binding relationship with users by clicking the content in **Referral List**. If the user has already visited our website before, since they will automatically be assigned a Login Code when they first visit our platform, that Login Code will not establish a binding relationship with you
