    For replies you're not satisfied with, you can click the refresh button to resend the request

    ![Refresh Gi](/images/Aggregation/Model-Chat/refresh.gif)

    Models themselves cannot access the internet, so their sense of time stays at the **knowledge cutoff date**

    After enabling the internet function, models can access the latest information on the web. We also support directly entering URLs to let AI analyze specific webpage content

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Backup Records">
    For user privacy, chat records are saved locally in your browser by default

    However, since local browsers have strict storage space limitations, we recommend that you choose at least one method for backup

    ### Cloud Sync

    After clicking the sync conversation button, in the popup menu, you can choose to **manually sync to cloud**, or enable **auto sync**

    After enabling auto sync, chat records will be fully synced to the cloud once per hour
