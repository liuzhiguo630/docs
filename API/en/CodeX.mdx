  <Step title="Step 1 - Install Node.js">
    <Card title="Verify Node.js Installation" img="/images/API/ClaudeCode/step-1.png">
      Open terminal and enter `node --version` and `npm --version` to verify Node.js installation
      If you see a version number like `v22.16.0`, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, please download from the official website https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    </Card>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2 - Install CodeX">
    <Card title="Install CodeX" img="/images/API/CodeX/step-2.png">
      Open terminal and enter `npm i -g @openai/codex` to install CodeX globally
      After successful installation, use the `codex` command in the target folder path (such as the folder where you will create/modify code)
      As shown in the image, installation is successful (this is just to check if installation is successful, no interaction is needed, just use `Ctrl+C` to exit after successful startup)

  <Step title="Step 3 - Method A: Modify Configuration File for Persistence [Recommended]">
      <Card title="Edit Configuration File" img="/images/API/CodeX/step-3.png">
        Then use your operating system to enter the `~/.codex` path, use `vim` or other tools to create or edit the `config.toml` file, and add the following configuration:
        ```text config.toml {2,3}
        model_provider = "liao"

        [model_providers.liao]
        name = "liao"
        base_url = "https://cc.liaobots.work/codex/v1"
        env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
        wire_api = "responses"
        request_max_retries = 4
        stream_max_retries = 5
        stream_idle_timeout_ms = 300000
        ```
        Then create an `auth.json` file in the `~/.codex` path with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "OPENAI_API_KEY": "Your Login Code"
        }
        ```
      </Card>
    </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3 - Method B: Configure Environment Variables (Choose either Method A or B)">
    <Card title="Edit Configuration File">
      Configure temporary or permanent environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for your command line

      Mac / Linux:
      ```shell
      export OPENAI_API_KEY=Your Login Code
      export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://cc.liaobots.work/codex/v1
      ```

      Windows:
      ```bash
      set OPENAI_API_KEY=Your Login Code
      set OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://cc.liaobots.work/codex/v1
      ```
      The above examples are temporary environment variables. If you need to modify permanent environment variables, please find tutorials yourself
